# Card Game AI Tester Application Idea

The project is an application designed to rapidly prototype and iterate on card game designs. It functions by ingesting a game designer's rules, automatically generating a playable engine and digital assets, and providing a platform for testing.

## Core Features

1.  **Ingest Rules:** Allow a game designer to upload a document containing the rules of their card game.

2.  **AI Interpretation:** Use an AI to parse the document, understand the core mechanics, and identify specific rules, card effects, and game flow.

3.  **Automatic Engine Generation:** The AI will translate the interpreted rules into a functional, playable game engine.

4.  **Leverage a Core Framework:** This custom engine will plug into a pre-existing framework that already handles the basic building blocks of any card game (e.g., shuffling decks, drawing cards, managing hands, turn order).

5.  **Generate Digital Assets:** The AI will also create the initial set of digital cards based on the rules, populating them with the necessary text and attributes.

6.  **Phased Rollout:**
    * **Phase 1 (MVP):** Start with a local, "pass-and-play" version for designers to quickly test the core feel of their game.
    * **Phase 2 (Full Release):** Expand to a web-based platform where users can create sessions and playtest with others remotely.

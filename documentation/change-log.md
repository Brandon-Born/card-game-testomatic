#### 2024-12-20 - Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T00:15:00Z

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin error

**Problem**: 
- Next.js development server was failing with PostCSS error
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires separate `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Error: "It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin"

**Solution**:
- âœ… Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to stable v3.4.0
- âœ… Maintained existing shadcn/ui-compatible configuration
- âœ… Verified PostCSS configuration compatibility
- âœ… Restarted development server successfully

**Status**: Next.js app now running without errors at http://localhost:3000

#### 2024-12-20 - Git Configuration Setup
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T00:30:00Z

**Work Performed**: Configured comprehensive .gitignore for Next.js application

**Changes Made**:
- âœ… Updated .gitignore with comprehensive patterns for Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, testing, and deployment
- âœ… Verified git ignore patterns are working correctly (.next/, node_modules/, *.env files properly ignored)
- âœ… Protected sensitive files: environment variables, build artifacts, IDE settings, OS files

**Git Ignore Coverage**:
- **Dependencies**: node_modules/, package-lock.json (tracking), npm debug logs
- **Next.js**: .next/, out/, build/, dist/, next-env.d.ts
- **Environment**: .env*, Firebase config files, API keys
- **Build artifacts**: TypeScript build info, coverage reports, test results
- **IDE/OS**: .vscode/, .DS_Store, editor swap files
- **Deployment**: .vercel/, .firebase/, .netlify/

**Environment Variables**: Developers need to create `.env.local` with Firebase, AI API keys, and Stripe configuration for full functionality.

#### 2024-12-20 - License Update
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T00:45:00Z

**Work Performed**: Updated project to be unlicensed

**Changes Made**:
- âœ… Changed license from "ISC" to "UNLICENSED" in package.json
- âœ… Updated README.md license section to reflect unlicensed status
- âœ… Verified no other ISC license references in source code (dependency licenses remain unchanged)

**Status**: Project is now properly marked as unlicensed with all rights reserved.

const damageListener = createEventListener({
  eventType: 'CARD_PLAYED',
  condition: (event) => event.payload.cardType === 'Lightning Bolt',
  callback: (event, game) => [
    createGameEvent({
      type: 'DAMAGE_DEALT',
      payload: { target: opponent, amount: 3 }
    })
  ]
})

// Integrate with game
const reactiveGame = addEventListenerToGame(game, damageListener)
```

**Next Steps**: Framework is complete and ready for Phase 0 Visual Rules Engine Designer implementation.

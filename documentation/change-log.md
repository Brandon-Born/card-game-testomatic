- ✅ Protected sensitive files: environment variables, build artifacts, IDE settings, OS files

**Git Ignore Coverage**:
- **Dependencies**: node_modules/, package-lock.json (tracking), npm debug logs
- **Next.js**: .next/, out/, build/, dist/, next-env.d.ts
- **Environment**: .env*, Firebase config files, API keys
- **Build artifacts**: TypeScript build info, coverage reports, test results

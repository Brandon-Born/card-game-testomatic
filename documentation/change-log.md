#### 2024-12-20 - Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T00:15:00Z

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin error

**Problem**: 
- Next.js development server was failing with PostCSS error
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires separate `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Error: "It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin"

**Solution**:
- âœ… Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to stable v3.4.0
- âœ… Maintained existing shadcn/ui-compatible configuration
- âœ… Verified PostCSS configuration compatibility
- âœ… Restarted development server successfully

**Status**: Next.js app now running without errors at http://localhost:3000

**Changes Made**:
- âœ… Updated .gitignore with comprehensive patterns for Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, testing, and deployment
- âœ… Verified git ignore patterns are working correctly (.next/, node_modules/, *.env files properly ignored)
- âœ… Protected sensitive files: environment variables, build artifacts, IDE settings, OS files

**Git Ignore Coverage**:
- **Dependencies**: node_modules/, package-lock.json (tracking), npm debug logs
- **Next.js**: .next/, out/, build/, dist/, next-env.d.ts
- **Environment**: .env*, Firebase config files, API keys
- **Build artifacts**: TypeScript build info, coverage reports, test results
- **IDE/OS**: .vscode/, .DS_Store, editor swap files
- **Deployment**: .vercel/, .firebase/, .netlify/

**Environment Variables**: Developers need to create `.env.local` with Firebase, AI API keys, and Stripe configuration for full functionality.

#### 2024-12-20 - License Update
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T00:45:00Z

**Work Performed**: Updated project to be unlicensed

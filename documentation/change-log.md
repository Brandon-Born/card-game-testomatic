#### 2025-01-13 - PROJECT-DRIVEN AUTOMATIC CARD DEALING IMPLEMENTATION ‚úÖ
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T08:00:00Z

**Major Feature**: Implemented comprehensive project-driven automatic card dealing system

**New Features Added**:
- **üÉè Automatic Card Dealing**: Cards are now automatically dealt at game start based on project configuration
- **‚öôÔ∏è Game Configuration Interface**: Added `GameConfiguration` type with `initialSetup` options
- **üîÄ Multiple Dealing Modes**: Support for both round-robin and sequential dealing orders
- **üéõÔ∏è Resource Configuration**: Project-defined player starting resources (life, mana, chips, etc.)
- **üîÄ Optional Deck Shuffling**: Configurable deck shuffling before dealing
- **üõ°Ô∏è Graceful Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks when insufficient cards or missing zones

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Enhanced Type System**: Added `GameConfiguration` interface to support project-driven setup
- **Updated Project APIs**: Extended `ProjectData` and `GameProject` interfaces to include `gameConfig`
- **ProjectManager Integration**: Updated save/load functionality to handle game configuration
- **GameBoard Enhancement**: Added automatic dealing logic with comprehensive error handling
- **UI Component**: Created `GameConfigPanel` for configuring dealing rules and player resources

**Configuration Options Available**:
```typescript
{
  initialSetup: {
    dealingRules: {
      enabled: boolean,           // Enable/disable automatic dealing
      handSize: number,          // Number of cards to deal per player
      shuffleDeck: boolean,      // Shuffle before dealing
      dealingOrder: 'round-robin' | 'sequential'
    },
    playerResources: {
      [resourceName]: number     // e.g., { life: 20, mana: 0, chips: 1000 }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases Supported**:
- **Magic-style Games**: Life: 20, Mana: 0, hand size 7, round-robin dealing
- **Poker Games**: Chips: 1000, hand size 2, sequential dealing
- **Custom Games**: Any combination of resources and dealing rules
- **No Dealing**: Traditional manual dealing when disabled

**Comprehensive Testing**:
- **5 New Integration Tests**: Cover all dealing scenarios and edge cases
- **Error Handling Tests**: Verify graceful behavior with insufficient cards/zones
- **Resource Tests**: Confirm player resources are set correctly
- **All 355 Tests Pass**: No regressions in existing functionality

**Project Examples**:
- **UNO**: `handSize: 7, shuffleDeck: true, dealingOrder: 'round-robin'`
- **Texas Hold'em**: `handSize: 2, playerResources: { chips: 1000 }, dealingOrder: 'sequential'`
- **Magic**: `handSize: 7, playerResources: { life: 20, mana: 0 }, shuffleDeck: true`

This enhancement makes the framework fully project-driven for initial game setup, allowing creators to define exactly how their games should start automatically.

#### 2025-01-13 - SIMULATOR DYNAMIC LAYOUT & ZONE VERIFICATION ‚úÖ
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T05:30:00Z

**Major Enhancement**: Made simulator fully project-driven, removing all hardcoded assumptions

**Root Cause of User Issue**: 
User's "GO GO GO" project only had 1 custom zone (player1 discard) but simulator was still showing hardcoded elements:
- Fixed "Battlefield" header appearing when no play areas exist
- Fixed "Life: 20 | Mana: 0" resources being hardcoded for all games
- Fixed 2-player layout assumption when project only needs 1 player

**Issues Found & Fixed**:
1. **Hardcoded Player Resources**: Players always showed "Life: 20, Mana: 0" regardless of game design
2. **Fixed UI Layout**: Always showed 3-row layout (Player 2, Battlefield, Player 1) even for single-player games
3. **Shared Zone Display Bug**: GameBoard component wasn't displaying zones with `owner: null` (shared zones)
4. **Hardcoded Player Count**: Always created exactly 2 players instead of detecting from zone ownership
5. **Missing Type Definition**: Added `zones?: ZoneTemplate[]` to `GameProject` interface in types

**Major Improvements Made**:
- **Dynamic Player Creation**: Only creates players that are actually referenced in zone ownership
- **Dynamic Resource Display**: Shows actual player resources or "No resources defined" instead of hardcoded values
- **Flexible UI Layout**: Renders player sections dynamically based on actual players, not fixed 2-player assumption
- **Conditional Sections**: Battlefield section only appears if there are shared zones or play areas
- **Smart Zone Detection**: Handles single-player games and custom zone configurations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases like missing players in zone creation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/game/GameBoard.tsx`: Complete overhaul to make layout project-driven
- `src/types/index.ts`: Added zones field to GameProject interface
- `src/tests/integration/simulator-zone-integration.test.tsx`: New comprehensive test suite

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ All 350 tests pass, including 4 new zone integration tests
- ‚úÖ Single-player games work correctly
- ‚úÖ Custom resources display properly (or show "No resources defined")
- ‚úÖ Shared zones render in dedicated sections
- ‚úÖ Dynamic layout adapts to any zone configuration

**Impact**: Simulator now truly reflects the project's zone design instead of imposing hardcoded game assumptions. Your "GO GO GO" project will now show only Player 1 with a Discard zone and no unnecessary battlefield or resource displays.

#### 2025-01-13 - ZONE SAVING BUG FIX üêõ
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T03:30:00Z

**Bug Fix**: Fixed critical issue where zones were not being saved in project data

**Root Cause**: Backend API routes were not extracting or saving the `zones` field from project data
- POST `/api/projects` was only extracting `{ name, description, cards, rules }` but ignoring `zones`
- PUT `/api/projects/[id]` had the same issue for project updates

**Issues Fixed**:
- **Project Creation**: Added `zones = []` to destructuring in POST route
- **Project Updates**: Added `zones` extraction and update logic in PUT route  
- **Firestore Storage**: Added `zones` field to projectData object saved to database
- **UI Feedback**: Added zones count display in save dialog for better user visibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`: Fixed POST route to handle zones
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts`: Fixed PUT route to handle zones  
- `src/components/designer/ProjectManager.tsx`: Added zones count in save dialog

**Impact**: Zone configurations created in the Zone Designer will now properly persist when saving projects

#### 2025-01-13 - TYPE DEFINITIONS CONSOLIDATION üîß
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T03:00:00Z

**Code Quality**: Consolidated duplicate type definitions into shared types

**Issues Fixed**:
- **Duplicate GameEvent interfaces**: Removed duplicate from `core/actions/core.ts`, now using single definition from `@/types`
- **Isolated ZoneTemplate interface**: Moved from `ZoneDesigner.tsx` to shared `@/types` for reusability
- **Inconsistent import patterns**: Standardized all imports to use consolidated types from `@/types`

**Type Consolidation**:

#### 2025-01-13 - SIMULATOR PROJECT LOADING FIX üîß
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-13T01:15:00Z

**Issue Fixed**: Game simulator wasn't displaying saved projects

**Root Cause**: Simulator page was using `useProjectManager` hook but never calling `loadProjects()` to fetch projects from backend

**Solution**:
- Added missing `loadProjects` to hook destructuring in `/simulator` page
- Added `useEffect` to automatically call `loadProjects()` when component mounts and when user changes
- Now simulator properly loads and displays all saved projects in dropdown

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/simulator/page.tsx`: Added project loading logic
**Verification**: Development server logs show successful API calls (`GET /api/projects 200`)

#### 2025-01-03 - CRITICAL PROJECT SAVE/LOAD BUG FIX! üõ†Ô∏è
**Timestamp**: 2025-01-03T02:30:00Z

**Work Performed**: Fixed critical bug where project data wasn't being properly loaded after save/refresh cycle

**Issue Identified**: 
- Projects were saving correctly to Firebase, but loading was failing silently
- Root cause: Async state timing issues in React components and missing useEffect handlers

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ **Fixed ProjectManager Load Logic**: Updated `handleLoad` to use returned project data instead of stale state
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced useProjectManager Hook**: Modified `loadProject` to return project data directly for immediate use
- ‚úÖ **Added RuleDesigner State Sync**: Implemented `useEffect` to properly load/save React Flow nodes and edges
- ‚úÖ **Improved Data Flow**: Rules now saved as `{ nodes, edges }` format and properly restored on load
- ‚úÖ **CardDesigner Already Working**: Confirmed CardDesigner had proper `useEffect` handling

**Technical Fix Details**:
- **ProjectManager.tsx**: `handleLoad` now uses `const project = await loadProject(projectId)` 
- **useProjectManager.ts**: `loadProject` now returns the loaded project data directly
- **RuleDesigner.tsx**: Added `useEffect` hooks to sync between props and internal React Flow state
- **Data Format**: Rules stored as array containing `{ nodes, edges }` object for React Flow state

**Additional Fix - Card Save Issue**:
- ‚úÖ **CardDesigner State Sync**: Added missing `onCardsChange` calls in `handleCreateCard`, `handleDeleteCard`, and `handleSaveCard`
- ‚úÖ **Parent Component Notification**: Cards now properly notify parent component when modified

**Testing Results**: 
- ‚úÖ Save project with cards and rules
- ‚úÖ Refresh page / sign out and back in
- ‚úÖ Load project - all cards and rules now restore correctly
- ‚úÖ Visual rules (triggers/actions) and connections maintained
- ‚úÖ Card definitions with all properties restored
- ‚úÖ Card creation, editing, and deletion now properly saves to project

**Impact**: Users can now reliably save their work and return to it later without data loss. Both cards and rules save/load cycle now works perfectly across browser sessions.

#### 2024-12-20 - CRITICAL FIX: Restored Real Firebase Backend Persistence - REAL USER-TIED STORAGE! üî•
**Timestamp**: 2024-12-20T23:45:00Z

**Work Performed**: Restored complete Firebase Admin SDK integration for REAL persistent storage

**MAJOR CORRECTION**:
- ‚ùå **Previous Error**: Removed Firebase Admin SDK and replaced with mock data
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Restored full Firebase Admin SDK with real Firestore persistence
- ‚úÖ **Goal Achieved**: User authentication now enables REAL project persistence

**Real Firebase Backend Restored**:
- ‚úÖ **firebase-admin Package**: Properly installed and configured
- ‚úÖ **Token Verification**: Real Firebase ID token validation
- ‚úÖ **Firestore Operations**: All CRUD operations write to actual Firestore
- ‚úÖ **User Ownership**: Projects truly tied to authenticated user accounts
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Proper user verification and ownership validation

**API Endpoints Now REAL**:
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/projects` - Queries user's actual Firestore projects  
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/projects` - Saves to real Firestore with user ownership
- ‚úÖ `PUT /api/projects/[id]` - Updates real Firestore documents
- ‚úÖ `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` - Deletes from real Firestore  
- ‚úÖ **401 Unauthorized**: Correctly enforced for unauthenticated requests

**Authentication Integration**:
```typescript
// Real token verification
const adminAuth = getAuth()
const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(token)
const uid = decodedToken.uid

// Real Firestore operations
const projectsRef = collection(db, 'projects')
const q = query(projectsRef, where('ownerUid', '==', uid))
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(q)
```

**User Experience Now**:
1. **Sign in with magic link** ‚Üí Real Firebase Auth token
2. **Save project** ‚Üí Actually writes to Firestore with user ownership  
3. **Load projects** ‚Üí Reads your real saved projects from Firestore
4. **Data persists** ‚Üí Refresh page, projects are still there
5. **Multi-device** ‚Üí Same user can access projects from anywhere

**Fallback for Development**:
- If Firebase Admin token verification fails in development, falls back to dev mode
- Graceful degradation while maintaining security in production

**REAL PERSISTENCE ACHIEVED**: 
Projects are now truly saved to Firebase Firestore and tied to user accounts. The original vision of early authentication enabling real backend persistence is fully implemented!

**Ready for Production**: Complete user-tied project management with Firebase security!

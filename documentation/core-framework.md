# Core Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Card Game Testomatic core framework provides a complete, immutable foundation for building any type of card game. Built with Test-Driven Development (TDD), the framework consists of three main components working together to create a robust game engine.

## Architecture

### The Three Pillars ✅ COMPLETE

1. **Game Object Primitives (The Nouns)** - Core data structures ✅
2. **Action Library (The Verbs)** - State manipulation functions ✅
3. **Event System (The Logic)** - Reactive triggers and responses ✅

## Game Object Primitives

### Card Object
```typescript
interface Card {
  readonly id: CardId
  readonly name: string
  readonly text: string
  readonly type: string
  readonly owner: PlayerId
  readonly currentZone: ZoneId
  readonly properties: Record<string, any>
  readonly counters: Counter[]
  readonly isTapped: boolean
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Immutable creation and updates
- Counter management (+1/+1, poison, etc.)
- Tap/untap state tracking
- Flexible property system
- Owner and zone tracking

**Test Coverage:** 24 tests covering creation, immutability, counters, properties, and validation.

### Zone Object
```typescript
interface Zone {
  readonly id: ZoneId
  readonly name: string
  readonly owner: PlayerId | null
  readonly cards: CardId[]
  readonly visibility: 'public' | 'private'
  readonly order: 'ordered' | 'unordered'
  readonly maxSize?: number
}
```

**Zone Types:**
- **Deck**: Private, ordered zone for drawing cards
- **Hand**: Private, unordered zone for playable cards
- **DiscardPile**: Public, ordered zone for used cards
- **PlayArea**: Public, unordered zone for active cards
- **Stack**: Public, ordered zone for resolving effects

**Capabilities:**
- Card addition/removal with position control
- Shuffling support for ordered zones
- Size limits and capacity checking
- Visibility controls for private information

**Test Coverage:** 30 tests covering all zone types, operations, and edge cases.

### Player Object
```typescript
interface Player {
  readonly id: PlayerId
  readonly name: string
  readonly resources: Record<string, number>
  readonly zones: ZoneId[]
  readonly counters: Counter[]
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Resource management (life, mana, custom resources)
- Zone ownership tracking
- Counter management (poison, experience, etc.)
- Immutable updates with validation

**Test Coverage:** 43 tests covering resources, zones, counters, and utilities.

### Game Object
```typescript
interface Game {
  readonly id: GameId
  readonly players: Player[]
  readonly zones: Zone[]
  readonly cards: Card[]
  readonly currentPlayer: PlayerId
  readonly phase: string
  readonly turnNumber: number
  readonly stack: Stack
  readonly globalProperties: Record<string, any>
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Master container for all game state
- Player management and turn order
- Phase progression (upkeep, main, combat, end)
- Global property system
- Automatic stack management

**Test Coverage:** 45 tests covering all management functions and state queries.

## Action Library

The Action Library provides immutable functions that manipulate game state. All actions validate prerequisites and provide detailed error messages.

### Core Actions

#### MoveCard
```typescript
moveCard({
  cardId: CardId,
  fromZone: ZoneId,
  toZone: ZoneId,
  position?: number
})
```
Transfers cards between zones with optional position control.

#### DrawCards
```typescript
drawCards({
  playerId: PlayerId,
  count: number
})
```
Moves cards from player's deck to hand with validation.

#### PlayCard
```typescript
playCard({
  cardId: CardId,
  playerId: PlayerId,
  targets: (CardId | PlayerId)[]
})
```
Moves cards from hand to play area, checking mana costs and ownership.

#### ModifyStat
```typescript
modifyStat({
  target: CardId | PlayerId,
  stat: string,
  value: number
})
```
Changes numerical properties on cards or players.

### Specialized Actions

- **TapCard/UntapCard**: Card state management
- **DiscardCard**: Hand to discard pile transfer
- **ShuffleZone**: Randomize ordered zones
- **AddCounter/RemoveCounter**: Counter management
- **SetTurnPhase**: Phase progression

### Action Execution

```typescript
// Validate before execution
if (canExecuteAction(game, action)) {
  const newGame = executeAction(game, action)
  // Game state is immutably updated
}
```

**Test Coverage:** 33 tests covering all actions, validation, and complex sequences.

## Event System

The Event System provides reactive pub/sub logic that connects actions to triggers, forming the heart of game rules.

### Core Components

#### Event Manager
```typescript
interface EventManager {
  readonly listeners: EventListener[]
  readonly eventQueue: GameEvent[]
  readonly isProcessing: boolean
  readonly maxQueueSize?: number
  readonly enableLogging?: boolean
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- Event creation with unique IDs and timestamps
- Queue management with overflow protection
- Priority-based listener execution
- Recursive event processing with loop prevention

#### Event Listeners
```typescript
interface EventListener {
  readonly id: string
  readonly eventType: string
  readonly callback: (event: GameEvent, game: Game) => GameEvent[] | void
  readonly condition?: (event: GameEvent) => boolean
  readonly priority: number
}
```

**Features:**
- Conditional execution based on event properties
- Priority ordering for deterministic execution
- Callback functions that can generate new events
- Dynamic subscription/unsubscription

#### Game Events
```typescript
interface GameEvent<T = any> {
  readonly id: string
  readonly type: string
  readonly payload: T
  readonly timestamp: Date
  readonly triggeredBy: PlayerId | 'system'
}
```

**Built-in Event Types:**
- `TURN_START` / `TURN_END`
- `CARD_PLAYED` / `CARD_DRAWN`
- `DAMAGE_DEALT` / `TARGET_SELECTED`
- `COMBAT_PHASE_START` / `MANA_SPENT`
- `COUNTER_ADDED` / `PLAYER_ELIMINATED`

### Event Processing

```typescript
// Subscribe to events
const listener = createEventListener({
  eventType: 'CARD_PLAYED',
  condition: (event) => event.payload.cardName === 'Lightning Bolt',
  callback: (event, game) => [
    createGameEvent({
      type: 'DAMAGE_DEALT',
      payload: { target: event.payload.target, amount: 3 }
    })
  ],
  priority: 1
})

// Add to game
const gameWithEvents = addEventListenerToGame(game, listener)

// Events are processed automatically during game actions
```

### Advanced Features

- **Cascading Events**: Events can trigger other events
- **Loop Prevention**: Maximum recursion depth prevents infinite loops
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of callback errors
- **Game Integration**: Seamless integration with game state
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time gameplay

**Test Coverage:** 30 tests covering event creation, subscription, processing, and integration.

## Design Principles

### Immutability
Every operation returns new instances, never mutating existing objects. This ensures:
- Predictable state changes
- Easy undo/redo functionality
- Safe concurrent access
- Clear data flow

### Validation
All actions validate prerequisites before execution:
- Resource availability (mana, cards in zones)
- Ownership checks
- Zone capacity limits
- Game state requirements

### Type Safety
Complete TypeScript coverage with branded types for IDs:
```typescript
type CardId = { readonly value: string }
type PlayerId = { readonly value: string }
// etc.
```

### Error Handling
Detailed error messages for debugging and user feedback:
```typescript
// Examples
"Card not found in source zone"
"Insufficient mana"
"Zone is at maximum capacity"
"Player does not own this card"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Game Setup
```typescript
// Create players
const player1 = createPlayer({
  id: createPlayerId(),
  name: "Alice",
  resources: { life: 20, mana: 0 }
})

// Create zones
const deck = createDeck({
  id: createZoneId(),
  owner: player1.id
})

// Create game
const game = createGame({
  id: createGameId(),
  players: [player1],
  zones: [deck],
  cards: [],
  currentPlayer: player1.id
})
```

### Action Sequences
```typescript
let gameState = initialGame

// Player draws a card
gameState = executeAction(gameState, drawCards({
  playerId: player1.id,
  count: 1
}))

// Player plays a card
gameState = executeAction(gameState, playCard({
  cardId: someCardId,
  playerId: player1.id,
  targets: []
}))

// Card gets tapped
gameState = executeAction(gameState, tapCard({
  cardId: someCardId
}))
```
